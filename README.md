## Introduction

In this project, we have developed a Q-learning agent that navigates a 5x5 grid environment with obstacles. The agent learns to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles through reinforcement learning. The Q-learning algorithm updates its Q-table based on the agent's experiences in the environment.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robot-navigation.git
    cd robot-navigation
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Agent

To train the Q-learning agent, run the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py
```
This will train the agent and optionally save the trained model.

## Evaluating the Agent

To evaluate the performance of the trained agent, run the **evaluate.py** script:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
This will load the trained model and evaluate it over a number of episodes.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

1. **environment.py:** Defines the RobotEnvironment class, representing the grid environment.

2. **agent.py:** Implements the QLearningAgent class, which contains the Q-learning algorithm.

3. **train.py:** Script for training the Q-learning agent.

4. **evaluate.py:** Script for evaluating the trained agent.

5. **utils.py:** Utility functions for saving/loading models and plotting training results.

6. **requirements.txt:** Lists the dependencies required to run the project.

7. **README.md:** Project documentation.
